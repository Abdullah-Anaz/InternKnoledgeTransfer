<h1>What is a repository?</h1> 
<p>
	A repository is a project containing files and folders. 
	A repository tracks versions of files and folders. 
</p>
<h1>What is a branch?: </h1> 
<p>
	A branch is a parallel version of your repository. By default, your repository has one branch named main and 
	it is considered to be the definitive branch. 
	Creating additional branches allows you to copy the main branch of your repository and safely make any changes 
	without disrupting the main project.
